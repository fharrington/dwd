<div id='title'><h2>P4 proposal</h2></div>

<div class='content'>
For P4 i'd like to build on my <strike>3rd project and create an audio player that plays sounds linked to tiles that the user arranges in order to create their own "song"</strike> p2 project and create an audio sharing website for musicians to upload their new music and post it in a microblog format.  Users will be able to embed songs in posts and view their uploaded files in their profile.
