<div id='title'><h2>P3 proposal</h2></div>

<div class='content'>
For my P3 jquery project i'd like to create a robust "feature slider" similar to <a href='http://www.zurb.com/playground/orbit-jquery-image-slider'>Orbit Slider</a>.  I'd like to allow a user to create overlays, different transitions etc. easily for a webpage.  Not sure if i want to try and build an app to generate the code or just methods to make it's coding simple.
