<div id='title'><h2>P3 proposal</h2></div>

<div class='content'>
For my 3rd project I'm attempting to create a proof of concept for my 4th project. This will consist of draggable/droppable tiles that have sounds and visual feedback linked to them with the eventual (p4) goal of creating an audio player that plays sounds linked to tiles that the user arranges in order to create their own "song".
